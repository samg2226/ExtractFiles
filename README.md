# ExtractFiles
This is a Project that takes any file that is compressed and decompress the file or multiple files inside of it.

This is very similar to the ExtractHere ark manager on linux

Single_extract is the first version that works with one encrypted file and the Multiple_extract is one that can take one compresed file
and decompress the many files that are inside it
